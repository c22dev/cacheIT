# cacheIT !
Hide your apps in a cache to prevent deleting :)

## How do this works ?
It simply copy over all your apps contained in the Printers folder into a cached folder every 30 seconds.
It watches for modifications in your Printers folder every 30 seconds. If something is added, put it in the cache. If something is deleted, put it back in Printers.

## Power and performance consumption
Really really low. The first time it runs it could take some time depending on your app size but it shouldn't slow down your computer at all.

## Fake apps
If you see those zero kb apps that is an error. simply ignore it or delete it from cache and from printers folder.

## The two big disadvantages
- It doesn't keep folder structure. This could be fixed in the near future.
- If you want to delete an app manually you have to delete it both in the cache and in the Printers folder in less than 30 seconds (you gotta be fast)


Some real printers app might not be recovered if deleted.

Maybe some app bundle's parts will not be copied.
